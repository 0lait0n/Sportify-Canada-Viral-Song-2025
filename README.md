### Key Insights & Visualizations
⭐ A. Viral Longevity: Days on Chart by Artist
Interpretation
This visualization illustrates the total number of days each artist appeared on the Canadian Viral Chart. This metric measures true longevity, highlighting artists who sustain cultural impact vs those who peak briefly.
Top performers such as The Red Clay Strays, sombr, and Riley Green maintained long-term visibility with 5500–8000+ total days counted across tracks.
This indicates:
strong playlist rotation
loyal fan engagement
repeated viral cycles
consistent re-entry
Mid-tier artists like Zach Top, Leon Thomas, Ravyn Lenae show stable engagement but shorter cycles.
Lower-tier artists show short-lived spikes — often viral hits with fast declines.
